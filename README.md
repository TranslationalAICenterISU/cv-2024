# End-to-End Computer Vision: Live Session Code Repository

## Overview
This repository contains the code demonstrations and examples from the live sessions of the End-to-End Computer Vision course. It serves as a resource for students to review and practice the concepts covered in our weekly meetings.

## Structure
Each folder in this repository corresponds to a specific live session, organized by module number. Within each folder, you'll find:

- Python scripts (.py files)
- Jupyter Notebooks (.ipynb files)
- Any additional resources used during the session

## How to Use
1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Navigate to the folder corresponding to the live session you're interested in.
3. Open the files in your preferred Python environment (we recommend using the same setup as described in the course materials).
4. Feel free to run, modify, and experiment with the code!

## Prerequisites
- Python 3.7+
- PyTorch
- Other libraries as specified in the course materials

## Updating
This repository will be updated after each live session. Make sure to pull the latest changes regularly to stay up-to-date with the latest examples and demonstrations.

## Questions and Issues
If you encounter any problems with the code or have questions, please:
1. First, check the course discussion forum to see if your question has already been addressed.
2. If not, post your question in the relevant discussion thread on Canvas.
3. For urgent issues, you can also email the instructor directly.

Happy coding and learning!
